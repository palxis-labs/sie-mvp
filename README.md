# SIE MVP (Signed Instruction Envelope)

This repository contains a minimal reference implementation and spec for a Signed Instruction Envelope (SIE):
a cryptographically signed container for agent instructions (e.g., SKILL.md) that enables integrity checks,
publisher authentication, and policy gating prior to execution.

Status: MVP in active development.
